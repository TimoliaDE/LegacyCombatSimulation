# LegacyCombatSimulation

Simulates legacy combat (1.8.8) for legacy clients on modern (1.19+) servers. This project does does NOT try to simulate 1.8 pvp for 1.19 players. It only supports 1.8-1.12 clients.

## Why?
LegacyCombatSimulation was build for server (networks) who do not want to maintain multiple minecraft versions, but also dont want to completely drop 1.8 (as it is still commonly used in the pvp community)

## Milestones

12.03.2023: First build with correct motion tracking and knockbag
18.03.2023: First production ready release
